 Julia-OpenCV binding prototype
=====================

**NOTE:**
This project currently is a **minimal prototype** of Julia-OpenCV binding. It is under development.
It is **not** ready for common use and **only work** for Linux now.

How to use it
---------
Run Makefile, compile cv2.h and cv2.cpp to a shared library. Change the image path in test/read.jl. Run "julia read.jl".
