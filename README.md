 Julia-OpenCV binding prototype
=====================

**NOTE:**
This project currently is a **minimal prototype** of Julia-OpenCV binding. I will submit a  GSoC proposal and it will contain the implementation details that I planed.

How to use it
---------
Compile cv2.h and cv2.cpp to a shared library. Put cv2.jl in to same dir and run "julia cv2.jl"

This is only tested on Linux.
